		<p>GET TO KNOW ME</p>
		<P>Hello! My name is Angelica, and I am so excited you're here. I am currently based in Ann Arbor as a first-year Master's student in the School of Information at the University of Michigan.
			During vacation, I can be located in Chicago. I use photography as an escape from the realities of the world. Through my photography, I aim to capture
			the beauty of the subject(s) in an artistic and profound way to share a narrative. Each subject is different, and it is important
			I encapsulate their uniqueness through the camera lens. My portfolio consists of a multitude of narratives including
			personal portraits, nature, lanscape, and special occassions. If you would like to work with me, do not hesitate
			to reach out. Thank you.
		</P>
